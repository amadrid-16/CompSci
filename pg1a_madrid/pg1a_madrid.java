    * This program was fairly simple after I found that I needed the double slashes and
    * needed to skip lines by using more System.out.println functions. It was useful for 
    * learning a bit about how to print out what you want. I learned how to use the print
    * function. I was glad that I learned about the slashes that is where I needed the 
    * most help. It only took about 45 minutes to complete after knowing everthing I
    * needed. The best part of the assignment was definitely getting everything to come 
    * together and work properly. This assignment was well designed I would not change it.
